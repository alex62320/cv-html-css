### Requiere Nib and Stylus
Nib is a small and powerful library for the Stylus CSS language, providing robust cross-browser CSS3 mixins to make your life as a designer easier.

```
$ npm i nib stylus â€”save-dev 
```

### Command to compile stylus:

```
$ stylus -u nib -m -w -c -o assets/css/style.css index.styl
```

Later I will do the free version for Wordpress and ghost.
